And there appeared a doll that was once manufactured by the factory, ”Doll.”<br>
Through the slow cmprehension and adaptation of the environment around them, <br>
Roboroids and Doll are able to obtain “curiosity” and “playfulness”,<br>
Bringing them closer to human beings.<br>

And so…

The performers in "Gia" do not have lines, but instead show emotions through facial expressions and gestures. The characters are wonderfully acted in easy to understand ways, so even small children and foreigners who don't understand Japanese can enjoy it.

<h2 class="GothicTitle">Greeting from the director of Gear</h2>
<p class="textBody">
I believe that the essence of Japanese culture is based on the idea of harmony within an animistic conception of the world. The true richness that we seek can be found in the tapestry that transcends the monolithic economic value system and results from an exquisitely balanced interweaving of things that are diverse and contrasting.<br>
<br>
When gears of different sizes, colors and shapes are put together, they link to produce a new harmony, within which true beauty emerges.<br>
<br>
This production is an attempt to find new possibilities for a small theater and expand both the range of theatergoing opportunities and the spectrum of the population that enjoys them. It also proposes a way to create new attractions in the area and make the community more appealing to visitors.<br>
<br>
Together, we, the cast and staff, devote ourselves throughout the year to deliver a quality production for all to enjoy, regardless of age, gender, nationality and language spoken, so that as many people as possible can experience the stimulation of their five senses, and the emotions and sense of unity made possible only through live performance.<br>
<br>
We hope that you will enjoy the show.

<h3>Keito Kohara<br><span>Director</span></h3>
<p>
After experiencing a wide range of sites, from traveling shows by Kanji Fujiyama and Chocho Miyako to the Takarazuka Revue and Shiki Theatre Company to kabuki performances as a technical staff member, gained experience in Europe, mostly in Paris, as the technical director of Susan Buirge, the mother of contemporary dance, for about 7 years. Then, founded "Art Complex 1928" in 1999 as an effort to modernize the architecture of the former Mainichi Newspaper Kyoto branch and transitioned to the role of producer. With a theme of the complexity of art, in addition to theater production, continued activities related to the preparation of the artistic environment, such as establishment of a culture support fund and regeneration of shipyard ruins into "Creative Center Osaka." Also continues to start up various projects connecting cultural arts to the attraction of guests and revitalization of the city. In Kyoto, accomplished the 1,000th performance in June 2015 of "GEAR," the first long running content of its kind in Japan, and succeeded in exporting Japanese theater content overseas for the first time in November of the same year.
