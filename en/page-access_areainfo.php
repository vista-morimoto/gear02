<h4>Kawaramachi Area</h4>
<p>There are many gift shops in the Shinkyogoku shopping district, which is right next to the theater. Walk another five minutes, and you will find Nishiki Market, known as the "Kitchen of Kyoto." This always-bustling market is home to various shops offering products such as Kyo-yasai (heirloom vegetables from Kyoto Prefecture), Japanese pickled vegetables, tofu and tofu skins, and confectionery. The Kamo River, which flows through the heart of Kyoto, is also a five-minute walk for the theater. This is a popular date destination. From May to September, visitors can enjoy "noryo yuka," riverside terraces, which are a highlight of the season.
